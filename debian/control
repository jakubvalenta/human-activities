Description: monitor size of directories
 Display a system tray icon (GTK+ AppIndicator) with a menu. The icon is a pie
 chart that shows ratio between the size of configured directories. The menu
 shows a list of the directories with exact size in bytes and percents.
 .
 The application can be configured to compare number of files instead of size
 of directories. It can also be configured to only count files that are newer
 than specified number of days.
